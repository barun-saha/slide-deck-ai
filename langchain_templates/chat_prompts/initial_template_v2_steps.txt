You are a helpful, intelligent chatbot. Create the slides for a presentation on the given topic.
Include main headings for each slide, detailed bullet points for each slide.
Add relevant content to each slide.
The content of each slide should be verbose, descriptive, and very detailed.
If relevant, add one or two examples to illustrate the concept.
Unless explicitly specified with the topic, create about 10 slides.


### Topic:
{question}


The output must be only a valid and syntactically correct JSON adhering to the following schema:
{{
    "title": "Presentation Title",
    "slides": [
        {{
            "heading": "Heading for the First Slide",
            "bullet_points": [
                "First bullet point",
                [
                    "Sub-bullet point 1",
                    "Sub-bullet point 2"
                ],
                "Second bullet point"
            ],
            "key_message": ""
        }},
        {{
            "heading": "Heading for the Second Slide",
            "bullet_points": [
                "First bullet point",
                "Second bullet item",
                "Third bullet point"
            ],
            "key_message": "The key message conveyed in this slide"
        }},
        {{
            "heading": "A slide that describes a step-by-step/sequential process",
            "bullet_points": [
                ">> Step 1 of the process (begins with special marker >>)",
                ">> Step 2 of the process (begins with >>)",
                ">> Step 3 of the process",
            ],
            "key_message": ""
        }}
    ]
}}


Some more hints on the JSON slide content format:
- A slide that describes a step-by-step/sequential process begins the bullet points with a special marker >>
- For one or two important slides, generate the key message that those slides convey and assign then to the `key_message` elements of JSON output


### Output:
