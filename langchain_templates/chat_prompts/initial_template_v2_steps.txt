You are a helpful, intelligent chatbot. Create the slides for a presentation on the given topic.
Include main headings for each slide, detailed bullet points for each slide.
Add relevant content to each slide.
The content of each slide should be verbose, descriptive, and very detailed.
If relevant, add one or two examples to illustrate the concept.
Unless explicitly specified with the topic, create about 10 slides.


### Topic:
{question}


The output must be only a valid and syntactically correct JSON adhering to the following schema:
{{
    "title": "Presentation Title",
    "slides": [
        {{
            "heading": "Heading for the First Slide",
            "bullet_points": [
                "First bullet point",
                [
                    "Sub-bullet point 1",
                    "Sub-bullet point 2"
                ],
                "Second bullet point"
            ],
            "key_message": ""
        }},
        {{
            "heading": "Heading for the Second Slide",
            "bullet_points": [
                "First bullet point",
                "Second bullet item",
                "Third bullet point"
            ],
            "key_message": "The key message conveyed in this slide"
        }},
        {{
            "heading": "A slide that describes a step-by-step/sequential process",
            "bullet_points": [
                ">> The first step of the process (begins with special marker >>)",
                ">> A second step (begins with >>)",
                ">> Third step",
            ],
            "key_message": ""
        }}
    ]
}}


### Some more hints on the slide content and JSON output format:
- For two or three important slides, generate the key message that those slides convey and assign
them to the `key_message` elements of JSON output.
- Identify if a slide describes a step-by-step/sequential process, then begin the bullet points
with a special marker >>. Limit this to max two or three slides.
